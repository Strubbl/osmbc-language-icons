## How to add an icon

1. Clone this repository
2. Choose a template file from `icons-with-fonts/` folder
3. Copy that file with a new name of the language you want to add below the `icons-with-fonts/` folder. Make sure you choose a template which is already very similar to your target language so that you do not have many changes.
4. Install the Economica font
5. Edit the text in the new template file with Inkscape
6. Save your work in this file.
7. Now use "Save as" to create a copy of this file in the folder `icons-with-shapes/`
8. Select the text object and convert it to a path. This can be done with CTRL+Shift+C or via menu _Path â†’ Convert Object to Path_
9. Save your file and exit Inkscape
10. Run the script `./convert-inkscape-to-normal-svg.sh`
11. Create a pull request to this repository with your new icon
12. [Add the icon](https://osmbc.openstreetmap.de/dokuwiki/osmbc:how_to_add_a_new_language_icon) to the weekly backend and to OSMBC
